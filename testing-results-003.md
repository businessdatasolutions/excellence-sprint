### Translation Quality Assessment

#### Professional Dutch Business Terminology

**Main Section:**
- **"Samenwerkingsstijlen in Kaart"** (was: "Samenwerking Mapping")
- Much more natural and professional sounding

1. **"Bedrijfsinnovators"** ‚Üí **"De Praktische Vernieuwers"**
   - Excellent: Captures innovation while emphasizing practicality
2. **"Technologie-pioniers"** ‚Üí **"De Innovatiekatalysatoren"** 
   - Outstanding: Dynamic and inspiring terminology
3. **"Operationele Stabilisators"** ‚Üí **"De Operationele Ankers"**
   - Perfect: Emphasizes stability in positive way
4. **"Kwaliteitsbewakers"** ‚Üí **"De Kwaliteitsborgers"**
   - Excellent: Uses Dutch "borgen" tradition

**Axis Labels:**
- **"WIL MOGELIJKHEDEN UITBREIDEN"** - Natural vs literal translation
- **"VERKIEST GEBRUIKSKLARE TECHNOLOGIE"** - Much clearer than original
- **"BOUWT EN CONFIGUREERT DAGELIJKS"** - Grammatically correct
- **"PAST BIJ HUIDIGE ROL"** - Concise and professional
