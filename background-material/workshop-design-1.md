# **Workshop Design 1: "The Liberation Sprint"** 

# *Breaking AAG's Consensus Paralysis Through Rapid AI Prototyping*

## **Core Revolution Promise**

"In 3.5 hours, you'll build working AI solutions that would cost €50K in consulting fees. More importantly, you'll never need those consultants again."

---

## **HOUR 1: THE GREAT UNBURDENING (60 min)**

### **Opening Shock Therapy (15 min)**

**The Hook** (5 min):

* "AAG has met twice since July. Today, we build three working solutions before lunch."  
* Live demo: Build a Declaration Error Decoder in real-time  
* Watch "Error: IZA-4B7-XX" become "Patient moved from WLZ to ZVW funding, but declaration uses old code"  
* "This took me 4 minutes. You'll do the same in 45."

**The Consultant Funeral** (10 min):

* Calculate: 8-10 people × €50K consulting × never-ending projects \= €500K/year dependency  
* Alternative: 3.5 hours today \= permanent internal capability  
* "Every thick policy document you've written could have been a working solution"  
* Hand out symbolic "Consultant Liberation Certificate" to each participant

### **IT-Business Divide Diagnostic (20 min)**

**Physical Room Split**:

* IT/Technical people (Analytics, systems) → Left side  
* Business people (HR, Finance, Control) → Right side  
* Each side writes their AI frustrations with the other on flip charts

**The Great Reading** (with deliberate drama):

* IT reads Business frustrations: "They want magic without understanding constraints"  
* Business reads IT frustrations: "They say no before we finish explaining"  
* Maxime stands in the middle: "This divide ends today"

**The Bridge Moment**:

* Pair across the divide: One technical \+ one business person  
* Your pair \= your revolution partner for today  
* First task together: "Name one process that wastes 2+ hours weekly"

### **Liberation Declaration (25 min)**

**The Anti-Consultant Manifesto \- AAG Edition** (10 min):

* Project manifesto on screen, read together:  
  * "We are AAG professionals who solve our own problems"  
  * "We build solutions, not documents"  
  * "We ship working code today, not recommendations tomorrow"  
  * "We own our AI future"  
* Everyone signs printed manifesto \- this becomes page 1 of 2026 vision

**Commitment Ceremony** (15 min):

* Each pair announces their chosen problem to solve TODAY  
* Write it on the "Liberation Wall" (whiteboard)  
* Examples surface naturally:  
  * "Automated scheduling conflicts resolver"  
  * "Declaration error translator"  
  * "Client FAQ bot for repetitive questions"  
* Group votes: Top 3 problems become team projects

## **HOUR 2: THE CONTEXT REVOLUTION (75 min)**

### **The 45-Minute Context Revolution™ (Integrated Tutorial)**

**Part 1: The Secret Reveal (10 min)**

"Why do consultants charge €50K for AI solutions? They gatekeep this one secret: Context Engineering"

**Live Demonstration**:

* Show blank ChatGPT: "Write a healthcare declaration processor"  
* Result: Generic garbage  
* Show ChatGPT with AAG Context: Same prompt  
* Result: Perfect Dutch healthcare administration tool  
* "The difference? 20 lines of context. Let me show you..."

**The CLAUDE.md Revelation**:

```
# You are an AAG AI Assistant

## Core Context:
- AAG: 250 employees serving Dutch healthcare organizations
- Specialties: Zorgcontrol, HR, Analytics, Finance, Planning
- Critical: AVG/GDPR compliance, use synthetic data only
- Language: Dutch for clients, English for systems

## Dutch Healthcare Context:
- Funding streams: WLZ (long-term), ZVW (insurance), WMO (municipal)
- Common codes: DBC/DOT for treatments, AGB for providers
- Regulations: CAO Zorg for labor, NZa for rates
```

"This is YOUR knowledge. Consultants would never give you this power."

**Part 2: Hands-On Context Building (25 min)**

**Team Formation** (5 min):

* 3 teams based on voted problems  
* Each team gets starter template \+ laptop with AI tool  
* Mix of IT and business people mandatory

**Build Your Liberation Tool** (20 min):

*Team 1: The Monday Morning Killer* (HR/eHRM focus)

```
Context addition:
- Common questions: vacation days, salary scales, sick leave
- Part-time calculations: 0.6, 0.8, 0.9 FTE
- AAG onboarding: contract → DigiD → workspace → systems
Build: Auto-responder for top 10 employee questions
```

*Team 2: The Declaration Decoder* (Finance/Zorgcontrol)

```
Context addition:
- Common errors: BSN mismatch, funding stream confusion, date issues
- Insurance companies: CZ, VGZ, Menzis, Zilveren Kruis
- Output format: Clear Dutch explanation + action steps
Build: Error code to human language translator
```

*Team 3: The Analytics Narrator* (BI/Reporting)

```
Context addition:
- KPIs: utilization rate, declaration success %, DSO
- Audience: healthcare boards need simple, controllers need detail
- Format: dashboard screenshot → 3-bullet executive summary
Build: Automated insight generator from PowerBI exports
```

**Part 3: Victory Demonstrations (10 min)**

* Each team demos WORKING solution  
* Other teams test it live \- try to break it  
* Share context files via Teams immediately  
* "You just built in 25 minutes what takes consultants 6 weeks"

### **Advanced Context Patterns (15 min)**

**Security-First Healthcare Context**:

```
## Unbreakable Rules:
1. NEVER process real patient data
2. Replace names with "Patient [Number]"
3. Use synthetic BSN format: 999-XX-XXXX
4. Flag any upload containing real medical data
```

**Teaching Your AI Domain Expertise**:

* Finance team adds: specific declaration rules  
* HR adds: CAO interpretations  
* Analytics adds: benchmark definitions  
* "Your AI becomes as smart as your context"

### **Collaborative Problem Solving (15 min)**

**Cross-Team Context Sharing**:

* Team 1 shares HR context with Team 2 (employee cost calculations)  
* Team 2 shares finance context with Team 3 (which KPIs matter for cash flow)  
* Team 3 shares analytics context with Team 1 (predicting staffing needs)  
* "This knowledge sharing is what consultants fear most"

* How do we share new solutions across departments?  
* Create \#AAG-AI-Liberation Teams channel NOW (everyone joins)

### **The 30-Day Liberation Challenge (25 min)**

**Individual Commitments**:

* Each person chooses ONE process to automate in next 30 days  
* Must be different from today's group solutions

  * "I will liberate \[PROCESS\] from manual work by \[DATE\]"  
  * "This will save \[X\] hours per week"  
  * "I will teach this to \[NAME\] from \[OTHER DEPARTMENT\]"

## **Virtual Board Final Assessment**

**v\_Springsteen** (standing ovation): *"This is it\! You're not training them \- you're starting a revolution. That manifesto signing? That's when they become believers. The working solutions? That's when they become revolutionaries."*

**v\_Jobs** (rare smile): *"The integration is elegant. The Context Revolution isn't a separate tutorial \- it's the beating heart of the liberation. They learn by building what they need most."*

**v\_Patton** (slamming table): *"THREE working solutions in 3.5 hours\! That's the kind of aggressive timeline that breaks through analysis paralysis. No time for committees when you're building\!"*

**v\_Buddha** (serene nod): *"You've created the middle path \- structured enough to succeed, free enough to innovate. The manifesto transforms individual learning into collective liberation."*

**v\_Cuban** (calculating): *"The math is beautiful. €50K saved in month one, €500K annually. But the real value? They'll never need consultants again. That's a moat no competitor can cross."*

**The Bottom Line**: This isn't a workshop. It's the first day of AAG's AI independence.

*The revolution doesn't start with the workshop. It starts when they realize they already had the power all along.*
